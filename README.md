# Room-Scheduler-GUI
A room scheduler GUI built in NetBeans (version 8.2) using SwingFX with a Derby database in the backend

This was a school project for a sophomore-level class. We were required to use an old verison of NetBeans (8.2) and Java JDK (8u281). I believe this is because JavaDB isn't included in current versions of NetBeans.

Requirements:\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;-Java JDK 8u281\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;-NetBeans 8.2
 
 Dependencies:\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;-JDatePicker\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;-JCalendar
  
  Instructions:\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;1) Install NetBeans 8.2 (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-3413139-esa.html) \
    &nbsp;&nbsp;2) Install JDK 8u281 (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) \
    &nbsp;&nbsp;3) Clone repository\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;4) Open a NetBeans project and find the repository directory\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;5) Resolve the dependencies (JCalendar and JDatePicker are in the "Dependencies" directory)\
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) \
    &nbsp;&nbsp;6) Go to the Services tab on the right hand side\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;7) Right click on Java DB and go to properties\
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set the following:\
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) Java DB Installation: Room Scheduler/derby/db-derby-10.14.2.0-bin\
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) Database Location: Room Scheduler/derby/Derby Databases\
